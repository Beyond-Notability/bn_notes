    "text": "Notes on some of the complexities\n\ngeneral concepts\nBroadly the main issues are variability in a. precision, b. certainty, c. formatting and d. omission rates.\nDates are a problem for just about everyone who has to work with them, whether historians or data people. (Sometimes the way that software attempts to deal with the problem makes them a problem for everyone else as well, such as the notorious eagerness of spreadsheet software to convert into date format anything that even remotely resembles a date.)\n\n\nwikibase structure and variety\nDates may be recorded as “main” (or top level) values or qualifiers, which need to be queried separately.\nThe majority of dates are qualifiers, and there are around 50 different properties for events or activities that might have qualifier dates. That is a lot of categories to try to analyse or visualise together.\nThen there are several different possible date properties\n\n\ndatatypes and technical constraints\nMain level dates may have one of two different datatypes: Time (ymdHMS format), which is the built-in Wikibase datatype, or EDTF (Extended Date/Time Format) for “fuzzier” dates. Qualifier dates (so far…) only have the Time datatype.\n\nTime dates are always stored and exported by the wikibase (and handled by R) in a year-month-day format, even if they’ve been recorded at a lower level of precision (eg year only); the precision level is stored separately and has to be specifically queried. (A year-only date, for example, is stored as YYYY-01-01, so without the precision level it’s impossible to differentiate it from an actual 1 January date.)\nEDTF dates are exported as text strings which need to be converted to dates separately. So far they’ve been used in a fairly straightforward way, mirroring the precision levels for Time dates, but they could be much more complex including uncertainty, approximation, date ranges, etc. [This comment is not intended as encouragement.]\n\nIf I run a basic union query in the WQS combining Time/EDTF dates in one column, the EDTF dates will be automatically simplified and converted to the same format as Time dates. So if I want to retain the extra information I have to separate out those variables and then re-combine them after processing.\n\n\nvarying precision/certainty in sources and recording them\nFor qualifier dates there are five different properties which reflect different ways that dates might have been recorded, or degrees of certainty in interpreting them: point in time; start time; end time; earliest date; latest date.\n\na pair of start time and end time represents a period of time\nbut often only one of start/end is recorded\npoint in time may represent either a discrete short term event or simply a known recorded moment in a longer duration\nit looks as though latest date can be very imprecise\n(and presumably earliest can be too, though I think there aren’t many of them)\n\n\nDates may not be recorded at all, and some dates are more likely to be recorded than others.\nA date might be missing because it really is completely unknown, or because the project doesn’t have time and resources to track down everything (!), or because some sources are work in progress, or simply because of technical issues fetching the data (eg The Bug).\n\n\ndata issues\nThere are occasional apparent inconsistencies in usage on the wikibase which can be difficult to interpret (ie, they could be errors but equally they could be deliberate choices to handle unusual cases): eg at time of writing there is one date for the property married name (for Olwen Brogan) and it’s not clear why this isn’t recorded as married in. [Update: this particular example has now been fixed.] I’d emphasise that such inconsistencies seem rare and minor problems.\nOccasionally there may be more than one recorded date to choose from (apart from start/end pairs), though I think there are fewer of these now than there were a few months ago. I think this might tend to occur because an event was recorded with different precision/certainty in different sources, so deciding which of the two dates to use (whether by editing the wikibase or filtering one out at the analysis stage) can be a choice between precision and certainty. Most I’ve seen are in the same year, in which case it’s a minor issue.\n(Annoyingly, some sparql queries return duplicates, which is a very different data problem from having multiple dates in a statement… but not necessarily immediately obvious to tell apart.)"

More generally, it can be difficult to ensure that dates in the same year but with low or different precision levels come out in the desired order (or even to decide what the desired order in those cases should be).\nA year-only date should display as 01/01/year but in some cases below the software package used to render the table is displaying them as 31/12 of the previous year, and I have no idea why: the underlying data is fine. (It may only affect certain dates.) I’ll work out how to fix it."

So with years ascending up the y axis, and all the women considered one big blotchy group (am sure that’s the technical term). What we want to get is an overview of whether certain kinds of PPA were more dominant at various periods of the overall period covered by the project, e.g. women suddenly started doing more excavation or whatnot in the 1910s, whereas before that there was almost no excavation activity associated with women. Project data on PPAs still very incomplete for post-1920s period, at least until CAS Earthworks and Blue Paper data is fully added, but even if we could begin to get a sense for the 1870 - 1920 period this would be very helpful to us.\n\n\nUpdated to use the PPA buckets\nI’ve moved the Big Blob versions to the bottom of the page since there was a clear preference for the separated approach!"

If so, it can’t simultaneously be used to say much about publishing trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe similarities between the two data sources are even more pronounced with a ridgeline plot (which shows proportions rather than numbers). The all-BN dates skew slightly more before 1920 and the LOC dates after that, but there’s not much in it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, it is more meaningful to compare dates for groups of women within the dataset; so for example, are there differences in chronology between women who publish only one book and those who publish larger numbers? Maybe not much, though the 2-5 books group have a bump 1900-20 and the 6-10 a bigger one 1920-40.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we can look at age profiles for publishing. (855 women have a year of birth; they’ve been split into four fairly balanced size groups.)\n(But bear in mind that the last age group get cut off by the 1955 end date for pubs.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollaboration\nCollaboration between BN women seems very limited; only 11 books of 886 record the involvement of more than one BN woman (17 women in all). But this was a small proportion of collaborative works as a whole, so this is just to highlight the BN-BN connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the broader picture of collaborative work, 132 women (59%) were involved in 294 books with multiple creators.\nThe picture here is quite complex; for example, being a solo editor/translator of a deceased author’s work(s) would hardly be the same kind of activity as co-authoring. I’d need to think about ways to tease out these differences and not sure I have time to do that now! (Especially as it would probably require some work cleaning up names.)\nThe most collaborative women"

    "text": "ADS journal articles\n\ncovers 1861-1960 [with 544 undated articles in analysis not requiring dates; a few of these might be later than 1960]\n6357 articles\n\n320 women (in 1438 articles)\n196 men (in 4973 articles)\n\n\nI decided to try some comparison of women and men since we have ADS IDs for plenty of the men. For men I’m using the limited data available on ADS person profile pages (which gives article title and date but not journals or co-authors); it would take several hours to do a second run fetching the fuller articles data for men so I’ve only done that for women.\nThere have to be some caveats about exactly what’s being compared, given the differences between inclusion of women and men in the database; male FSAs are presumably overrepresented, for example.\n\nnumbers\nFirst, the men published far more than women; this is probably not particularly surprising but the scale of the difference is striking. The 321 women in the data averaged 4.5 articles each, compared to 26.2 for the 196 men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond, there is a substantial difference in the distribution of publishing. 150 women published only one article (47% of the women), compared to only 23 men (12%). A violin plot captures the differences particularly nicely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut… since it’s possible that a preponderance of male FSAs (people who might be expected to be prolific authors) is skewing the data somewhat, what happens if the comparison is restricted to male and female FSAs?\n\n133 male and 62 female\nmale FSAs have been identified by a) being proposers/signers for female FSAs; b) listed as FSAs in wikidata\n\nThe difference is still there though considerably less pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are the most prolific?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchronology\nThe chronological pattern has some similarities to that of dates overall and LOC dates, at least for women. I’ve left out the men here because I don’t think much can be read into their numbers at all; there’s an apparent post-WW1 bulge in their publications but I’m pretty certain this simply reflects the addition of large numbers of men for SAL elections after 1920.\nThere are other problems with dates. A lot of publications are undated, and the missing data may not be randomly distributed. Some journals definitely have more missing dates than others. I’ve tried to fill in some particularly big gaps for a few important journals (including Folklore, for which ADS claims to have no dates for 1910-1949!). (It’s theoretically feasible to date all journal articles as long as you have volume number (and most do), but frustratingly hard to get hold of this information in a readily usable form.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of the shape of the ADS dates with all BN dates does show more difference than with the LOC books set. in each set for women: specifically, that growth after WW1 seems much slower and never really gets near to the early 20th-century peak (which I think is 1904 or 1905 [check] in both ADS and LOC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of ADS articles with LOC books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollaboration\nFirst, where co-authors are both/all in the BN database, including men.\nIt’s again a small subset. Only 199 articles had multiple BN authors, with 104 people involved. Within these, the largest number of people involved in one publication was 5; the mean was 2.2 and the median 2.\nOverall, men were more likely to appear as co-authors: 74 of 196 male authors (37.8%), compared to 30 women out of 320 (9.4%). Much of women’s BN co-authoring was with men rather than with other women.\n\n\n\n\n\ncollab_authors\nn_articles\n\n\n\n\nmen\n135\n\n\nmen women\n54\n\n\nwomen\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, this group of 30 women tended to be very collaborative. One third of all their articles were collaborative (33.8%) compared to less than a fifth of the men’s articles (17.7%).\nFemale BN-BN collaboration in ADS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop male BN-BN collaborators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTurning to the fuller women’s data for multi-authored publications, 72 women (22.4%) were involved in 177 multi-author articles (12% of 1439 articles).\nTop collaborators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturning briefly to the most prolific women, how collaborative were they? It varies a lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njournals\nWhich journals did women publish in most? Again with the more detailed ADS articles data for women only.\n(I’ve done some work to standardise journals where there is a single series but the name could change over time.)\nI think there might be interesting gendered differences in choices of journals (eg it looks possible that women published more than men in Folklore), but that can’t be tested without the full data."

Recurring events are a bit more complicated to handle when counting things.\nSo, for recurring events, “event” will refer to any/all instances of (eg) “meeting of the Folklore Society” (Q31 / Q292), “Royal Archaeological Institute Meeting” (Q29), and so on.\nMeanwhile, an “event instance” refers to a single occurrence of a recurring event (eg the meeting of the Folklore Society that was held on 17 December 1903), or a one-off event. For counting one-off events “event” and “event instance” are the same thing.\nFinally, an “event attendance” refers to one woman participating in one event instance. Sometimes the same event instance appears more than once on a woman’s page under different PPAs; unless the emphasis is on the specific activity rather than the event, I’ll reduce them to one for counting purposes.\nIdentifying what is a single instance of a recurring event is not always perfectly simple, especially given the different kinds of event present in the database. At present it’s based on three elements:\n\nthe main event item, which may be generic such as “meeting” (Q31) or a named event like the “Conference on the Future of Archaeology” (Q1859)\nparticularly for generic events, the of qualifier is used for more specific info (eg the name of the event/the organisation responsible). The less frequent organised by qualifier is also used (but only where it doesn’t have instance of human).\nthe date\n\nThere are occasional variations in recording that might cause records of the same event instance to be counted separately. Eg there can be variations in date precision across different records of an event or an event might have been held over several days, so some assumptions have to be made about date grouping which could occasionally go wrong.\nConversely, in a very small number of cases, the absence of specific information might cause distinct events to be collapsed into a single instance.\nIn a few cases, there’s more than one possible way to structure a record of what could be the same event, and this will mean that they get treated as different things. Eg, there are specific items for SAL and RAI Meetings, but there are also occasional records in the form “meeting (Q31) of RAI/SAL” and it’s unclear to me whether it’s intentional (a different sort of meeting?) or just an oversight. (But I’d emphasise that this is very occasional and a minor issue.)\n\n\nupdates\n\nadded more about event activities\nadded regions heatmap; and a heatmap excluding London\nadded tables of the counts in the heatmap\n\n\n\nTODO\n\nI may be able to make a few further improvements by pulling in some infrequently used qualifiers\nSeveral events are related to suffrage activities (or other interesting subjects); nothing is being done with this kind of information at the moment.

    "text": "Frequent attenders\nMany women turn up at only a small number of event instances. Who are the most frequent event attenders?\nAt least 8 attendances (ignoring different PPAs). About 140 women have only a single event attendance; about 40 went to 8 or more.\nJessie MacGregor is at the top because she exhibited at the RA Summer Exhibition almost every year from 1872 to 1904 (as well as six times at the Society of Lady Artists Exhibition).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy age groups\nat least 8 attendances\n\nfewer women in the late group\nearlier women more likely to accumulate &gt;20 attendances\nbut in the 8-12 attendances range the numbers in each group are actually very similar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut overall counts can obscure interesting differences in patterns of participation. Some women, like Jessie MacGregor, might tend to attend just one or a few events; others might be spread more or less evenly across a wider range of events and/or organisations.\nThere are too many different events/organisations to show labelled breakdowns but it’s still possible to use a breakdown to get an overview of the patterns. It’s possible to see the extent to which Jessie’s participation is concentrated in just the one event, compared to, say, Margaret Murray’s profile (though Murray is also exceptional!).\nIt’s noticeable that in many cases, even women who attend several different events tend to favour one over the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis colour codes the segments by event type; it’s kinda cute but I’m not sure if it’s useful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart can be flipped around, to look at patterns of participation by event rather than by person.\nConferences, as they’re all (or nearly all) one-off events aren’t very interesting except to show what a uniform one person per event pattern looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecurring events tend to share a similar and familiar sort of pattern (the flip side of women tending to prefer one event over others), that a relatively small number of people account for a high proportion of attendances, with a larger number of more irregular/occasional attenders. But the exact distribution varies; it may be more pronounced for smaller organisations’ events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause exhibitions are a mix of recurring and one-off events, they have a mixed pattern."

    "section": "Connections",
    "text": "Connections\nIn network graphs or other visualisations of connections I’m often using correlation coefficients rather than simple counts of pairs, so this is a brief explanation of what that means.\nCorrelation isn’t simply how often people are found together, which tends to give prominence to the people who appear most often in the data - Margaret Murray would turn up a lot for example, but that’s partly because she’s everywhere. Correlation coefficients are a measure of how likely pairs are to appear together relative to all the other possible pairs in the data. So they may be helpful for surfacing relationships that might not be immediately obvious simply from numbers.\nHence it’s possible to have negative as well as positive scores. Greens in the correlation plot show pairs who appear together more often than expected, purples (probably blues to James) are people who are apart more often than expected (which might sometimes be interesting too).\nCaveats\nCorrelations can be misleading in the opposite way from counts, if you have a lot of single appearances in the data (as we do). That can result in impressive looking scores of 1.0, but it just means that two women happen to be recorded just once, at the same event, which may be completely random and unrepresentative. So usually I’ll set a threshold of at least two/three appearances.\nMost of the correlations in this kind of data aren’t very strong by statisticians’ standards: +/- 0.4 is usually the threshold for “moderate” strength, although I think for exploratory purposes anything from 0.25 upwards can be of interest. (For reference, the Jessie MacGregor-Rosa Wallis link scores only 0.21.)\nA correlation plot of women with at least 9 attendances (it’s not really possible to squeeze more names in).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork graphs\n(darker lines represent stronger correlations)"

We’re not 100% sure what we want to do with this as yet, but as a starter to help us, do you think it might be possible, please, to do some visualisation that pulls together all flagged suffrage activity in our database across time? (We’ve also realised that some unflagged suffrage activity of event types has crept into the database so will aim to fix this, though we think all suffrage groups we know of are flagged.) Please note that we have also flagged anti-suffrage activity as suffrage activity, so preserving names of distinct suffrage orgs in whatever you come up with might be helpful.\n\nNearly all the suffrage activities in the database are dated, though charts ignore differences in kinds of date - positions are usually at year level while events are more short term. (Though they’re all point in time dates, I think, rather than start/end, so presumably none were of more than a year duration.)\nTODO\nlocations? will need more complex queries (which I’ll work out for the lecturing post first)"

Instead I’ve tried out “barcode” charts to chart timelines.\nEach vertical bar represents one date for which a suffrage activity is recorded (making no distinction between types of date). Unlike a beeswarm it won’t show every single data point if there’s more than one on the same date, but it’s possible to make more data points visible than with chunkier shapes like dots or squares, and it will indicate more intense clusters of activity (both horizontally, for individuals, and vertically, for the group as a whole).\n\norder by date of earliest activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norder by date of birth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only a single event needs to be plotted, a lollipop chart is also quite effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a dumbbell plot for the earliest and latest activities by each woman. There isn’t very much overlap (among women with more than 1 activity) between women who were active before 1908 and those who started 1908 or later. (But is this an absence, or just absence of data?) I’m not familiar enough with the historiography to know whether this might be expected; if not, handle with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparating out women with at least 2 activities\n\nordered by date of earliest activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a noticeable difference in activity types between the women with 1 activity and those with 2+. Going back to the earlier chart of PPA bucket counts, this version separates out the two groups but also shows the totals in light grey in the background - positions and societies are both quite evenly split between group 1 and group 2, but the 2+ women are much more involved in events (= mainly spoke at).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, on average members of the 2+ group were several years younger than the 1 group at the time of their first recorded suffrage activity; median age at earliest activity for 2+ is 42 and for 1 is 46.\nBut NB that this is only true of “early starters” (pre 1908) and the numbers are small (6 early starters and 5 later starters). So this needs to be treated with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLollipop chart of ages at earliest activity, sorted by date of the earliest activity, and coloured by group (1 or 2+ activities)."

People are “nodes” and the links between them, created by being participants on the same excavation, are “edges”.\nI think it should be borne in mind for the men in the network that this is only reflecting their connectedness to women, and they might not look exactly the same in a full set from the same sources that included male only excavations (which are presumably the majority?).\n\ndegree-distribution plots\nThe “degree” is a simple count of a node’s links. Counting how many nodes have each degree can tell you something about the overall structure of the network, which can be visualised in degree-distribution plots.\nWe’d quite like them to look something like these, in which a very small number of nodes have a lot of connections goes down (in a fairly straight line) to many nodes with a very small number of connections. This is a very common pattern in networks.\n\n(source)\nThis is what the degree-distribution plot for the whole excavation network actually looks like. Very very broadly speaking it’s somewhere in the same zone (a few nodes with high degree, a lot of nodes with low degree). But it has bulges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy period (excluding the handful of 1940s excavations).\nThe 1900s set is too small for any statistical analysis to be meaningful. The 1920s are a bit weird. The 1930s look much the same as the overall picture (considering they form the bulk of it, not surprising).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA different kind of split, by number of participants per excavation. Interestingly, the distribution of excavations with up to 5 people looks much more like the “expected” pattern. The bulginess is in the larger excavations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is happening because the large excavations have quite a lot of people who only appear in those large excavations, often in just one. If there are (for example) 20 people on an excavation and 18 of them are only recorded on that excavation, the 18 will all have degree of 18. Notably, the single larger 1920s excavation, Richborough (Q3380), has 17 participants and only three of them appear on any other excavation. (The decade as a whole has only 79 named participants in 43 excavations.)\nThis is one of the reasons why simply counting links between nodes in a network is a limited measure; it can be useful, like this, to get a picture of the network as a whole but misleading for understanding individuals within the network."

    "text": "Highly connected individuals\nThe limitations of counting links is why a number of different “centrality” measures have been developed in network analysis. These heatmaps compare rankings for four of the most commonly used:\n\ndegree (how many connections a node has)\nbetweenness (how well a node connects other nodes)\neigenvector (how close a node is to well-connected nodes)\nharmonic closeness (on average, how close a node is to every other node in the network)\n\n(I’m using rankings because the measures produce very different sorts of scores which are not directly comparable.)\nTop ten rankings are coloured and other rankings are in grey. The most striking thing here is just how much they can vary. Only one person (Tessa Verney Wheeler) is in the top ten on every measure.\nAn interesting absence is Margaret Murray who is recorded in 7 excavations (the same number as Mortimer Wheeler) but she has only 18 connections and her highest ranking is at 22 [betweenness].\nAlso perhaps worth noting that Maud and B.H. Cunnington are absolutely nowhere in any rankings in spite of being recorded on more excavations than anyone else (9), because they only connect to each other. That may reflect the sources too, given that most of their excavations were pre-WW1, though I see that Maud had a reputation for being “difficult”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there’s so much variation I hesitated over doing averages of the rankings; I’ve tried out a boxplot combined with beeswarm. It’s possibly a bit odd looking (lol) but I quite like it.\nIt turns out that at the top end of the chart (it’s been sorted by median average) there’s quite a bit of consistency; for 2 to 10 the lowest rankings are in the 20s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying the beeswarm/boxplots for sub-networks\n1930s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1920s\nThis decade looks really weird. (Miss Hobling, Aileen Fox and Joscelyn Plunket Bushe-Fox are the three Richborough people who are on at least one other excavation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-WW1\nAgain, a bit doubtful but does at least put some individuals you’d expect at the top. Margaret Murray’s back! I expanded it to the top 12 just to see where Petrie had got to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe big four problem\nSo far, so weird. The “big four” excavations (Maiden Castle, Colchester, Verulamium and Richborough) are really causing all sorts of problems here. While I would assume that they really were important and big excavations - hence the existence of detailed records compared to many others - they’re having some very disproportionate effects. This is most obvious for Richborough in the 1920s, given that there’s more data generally for the 1930s. But not confined to it.\nTo go back to the top 10s, several of these apparently high ranked individuals only appear in one or more of the big excavations. This may not necessarily be “wrong”; Wikipedia tells me that Hugh O’Neil really was an important figure in British archaeology. Huntley S Gordon, on the other hand, doesn’t even seem to be listed in the ADS library.\nI don’t want to drop the big excavations entirely. But could I remove some of their data to make them more consistent with the level of recording we have for other excavations?\nOne thing it’s easy to do is simply take out those people who do not appear in any other excavations and see what happens. (Yes, this is probably a really monstrous idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In this version Tessa and Mortimer have identical median average, though Tessa still comes out top by mean.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a more accurate picture of the most connected people in the network, but it is arguably a more useful one.\n\n\ncircles\nSome very simple graphs of the links for the top ranked. These are just their immediate connections (I can’t at the moment quite get a cleverer neighbourhood graph to work properly; will update if I can work out the problem).\nThe focus person is the centre node; the length and weight of edges represent the number of connections (shorter and darker = more connections). Colour is used for gender.\nHere’s Tessa Verney Wheeler’s “circle” including everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after removing the big-four-only individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame for Mortimer Wheeler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, this is the circle for Hugh O’Neil. (I’m not going to do any other ‘removed’ individuals because (guess what!) they’re virtually the same.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest are the “removed” versions only, but I can do the full ones if wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther circles of possible interest…\n(I can do others on request)"

Q2026 = Verulamium; Q2560 = Maiden Castle; Q90=Colchester; Q3380=Richborough.]\nThe overlap between Verulamium and Maiden Castle is very obvious. But Colchester accounts for only a handful of individuals in the set. Richborough also has only a couple. So, notwithstanding the problems with sources, this suggests there are some distinct clusters or communities in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA network graph of the whole network is otherwise not very revealing but also hints at some distinct clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut (of course!) there are multiple possible ways to identify clusters in a network. I tried out a few; many of them tended to give quite similar results. But I need to do more reading on the differences. Here I use one called edge betweenness (mainly because I think I at least understand the idea).\n\nThe idea behind this method is that the betweenness of the edges connecting two communities is typically high, as many of the shortest paths between vertices in separate communities pass through them. The algorithm successively removes edges with the highest betweenness, recalculating betweenness values after each removal. This way eventually the network splits into two components, then one of these components splits again, and so on, until all edges are removed. network graph highlighting the 8 largest community clusters.

Links between women who attended the same event instance (there are notes about methods for that in the original post); about 150 women have at least one link. Margaret Murray has the most links with (iirc) about 8, but most only have one or two. Women without any links at all have been filtered out.\nNode colours represent groups detected by R (using edge betweenness clustering; I may need a better algorithm for this). Size of nodes reflects number of event attendances. Apart from being grouped by colour, the force-directed layout should push more connected individuals closer together and pull less connected ones apart."

    "text": "Background\nThis is a particular kind of use case. It depends on considerable familiarity with the database. Crucially, the input data is already clean, structured and well suited to the task. So there’s no machine learning involved and very few of the tasks would be likely to need it, even if the database were much larger. It’s all fairly straightforward rules-based processing. (Nonetheless, I did find some of the literature on natural language generation helpful for thinking about how to make prose from structured data sources, not least in breaking down the process into its constituent parts, from document content and structure to linguistic structures to word order (eg see Reiter and Dale 1997, Duma and Klein 2013).)\nWhy would you even want to do this, having gone to all the trouble of creating a structured database? In general, I think it’s important to offer people different ways of accessing complex databases to suit different needs, for example, browsing, keyword searching, more structured searches, and sharing complete datasets.\nMore specifically, the BN wikibase is very large, complex and detailed, and it’s hard to know where to begin. People need some help to find their way around! So, for example, I made a summary spreadsheet of selected data for project partners at the SAL archives.\nI was also asked if it would be possible to make a “Directory” of mini-biographies for all the 900 or so women in the BN database, using selected categories of data. This would form an appendix to the project monograph, but also be useful as a standalone resource. It would offer a different way into the data, an introduction to the fuller ranger of information in the wikibase, and perhaps especially so for less “notable” women who don’t already have online biographies elsewhere.\nThere are older printed models for this. Some of the BN women appeared in the LSE Register 1895-1932, which crammed remarkable amounts of brutally abbreviated information about LSE students into its pages. For example:\n\nABRAM, Annie; deceased Oct. 17, 1930. Educ. Univ. of Cambridge (Hist. Tripos); Univ. of Dublin (B.A.); L.S.E. 1905-9, occ. to 1914; D.Sc. (Econ.) 1909.\n\n\nCHURCHILL, Irene Josephine; b. Dec. 18, 1887. Educ. Oakhurst Sch., Shortlands, Kent; Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (2nd .Cl. Final Hons., Sch. of Mod. Hist., 1910; D.Phil.1930); L.S.E.1910-9, Cert.’ in Hist. 1913. F.R.Hist.S. 1914. War service: Organising Sec., War Hospital Supply Depot, under D.G.V.O. (War Office),1916-9.

(The same thing applies in cases where we don’t know the conferring institution; only the degree label is certain to be present.)\nFor me, this is most easily handled with a conditional function (if_else() or case_when() for something more than a simple either/or): if the value isn’t NA, use the glue statement, else make it a blank (““).\n\ndegrees_query |&gt;\n  mutate(glue_year = if_else(!is.na(year), glue(\"in {year}\"), \"\")) |&gt;\n  select(person, glue_year) |&gt;\n  kable() |&gt;\n  kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\nperson\nglue_year\n\n\n\n\nQ916\nin 1907\n\n\nQ916\nin 1926\n\n\nQ536\nin 1906\n\n\nQ536\nin 1909\n\n\nQ317\nin 1930\n\n\nQ709\nin 1928\n\n\nQ709\nin 1933\n\n\nQ709\nin 1954\n\n\nQ3989\n\n\n\nQ3989\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ll need this several times, so it makes sense to convert that specific if/else instruction into a more general function which can be used with different prefixes, enabling a more modular approach.

Stewart was awarded a doctor of philosophy by University of Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n\npesky articles\nGenerally, item labels in the wikibase do not include definite or indefinite articles, which is perfectly proper and sensible in a database context. But it doesn’t work so well when they need to be inserted in prose sentences. There are two main sources of variation that cause problems:\n\nthere are two choices of indefinite article, “a” or “an”, depending on whether the item label starts with a vowel.\nthere are also two choices of definite article: some names (eg “Somerville College”) use the zero article\nalso, occasionally an item label does already have a definite article\n\nIn the case of indefinite articles for the degree labels, both the choice of a/an and the possibility of a/an already being present can be covered with a bit of regex.\n\nprefix_an &lt;- function(x) {\n    case_when(\n      # if the string x already starts with the word a/an, don't prefix anything\n      str_detect(x, \"^an?\\b\") ~ glue(\"{x}\"),\n      # if it starts with a vowel, prefix with \"an\"; \n      str_detect(x, \"^[AEIOUaeiou]\") ~ glue(\"an {x}\"),\n      # otherwise - as long as it's not *NA* - prefix with \"a\"; \n      !is.na(x) ~ glue(\"a {x}\"),\n      # keep anything left behind (should only be NAs) as it is\n      .default = x\n    )\n}\n\nMeanwhile, there are variable conventions in definite article usage for institution names in English. For example:\n\n“the University of Oxford” but not “the Manchester University”\n“the Courtauld Institute” but not “the Somerville College”\n“the University College of North Wales” but not “the University College London”\n\nI’m not sure how I know these differences, so a computer certainly isn’t going to be able to work them out without some help. If this were a much larger database, I might be thinking about machine learning methods (it could be an opportunity to try out word embeddings). But there are less than 200 different higher education organisations in the database, almost all of which can be covered by three rules, so it’s easier to create a rules-based list.\nWhatever method I might ultimately use, it’s helpful to do some modelling to understand something about what the patterns are likely to be in in my data. There are other types of organisation in the database where the conventions are different from (and, well, more conventional than) those of universities and colleges. Learned societies, for example, almost always take the definite article. Commercial organisations could be quite different again.\nIn this case, I already have a resource within the database that will cover many of the names. I’ve already worked out that names like “Placename University” or “Placename College” use the zero article, and the BN database contains more than 1000 items categorised as places. So I can reuse those. That handles about half the organisations; “the University/College/whatever of X” (definite) and “Name College” (zero) will deal with almost all the rest.\n(There are also a few non-English institutions in the database which may want separate treatment - if the text is in English, should it be “La Sorbonne” or “The Sorbonne”? I’m lazy so I’ll take the easier route for now.)\nThis will want another little function:\n\n# if the `category` is \"the\" use as prefix; otherwise leave as it is. \n# can be adapted further if necessary.\n\ndefinite_org &lt;- function(x, category){\n  case_when(\n    category==\"zero\" ~ x,\n    category==\"the\" ~ prefix_na(x, category, before = \"\"),\n    .default = x\n    )\n}\n\nFirst, get all the items in the wikibase that have instance of “locality”.\n\nlocation_sparql &lt;-\n'SELECT distinct ?locationLabel ?location   \nWHERE {  \n  ?location bnwdt:P12 bnwd:Q2147 . # i/o locality\n  SERVICE wikibase:label { \n    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en,en-gb\". \n    } \n}'\n\nlocation_query &lt;-\n  bn_std_query(location_sparql) |&gt;\n  make_bn_ids(location) |&gt;\n  arrange(locationLabel)\n\nlocation_rgx &lt;-\nlocation_query |&gt;\n  # filter out a few generics that start [a-z]\n  filter(str_detect(locationLabel, \"^[A-Z]\")) |&gt;\n  # remove some unwanted stuff and then make unique\n  mutate(locationLabel = str_trim(str_remove(locationLabel, \" *\\\\((district|village|borough|parish|area|county|unitary authority|civil parish|community|region|settlement|city|council area)\\\\)\"))) |&gt;\n  distinct(locationLabel) |&gt;\n  # turn them into a regex with a | separator\n  summarise(rgx = glue_collapse(locationLabel, sep=\"|\")) |&gt;\n  # final regex: \n  # must be at the beginning of the name \n  # \\\\b at the end to avoid scunthorpes\n  # add a few placenames that didn't turn up in the database\n  mutate(rgx = glue(\"^({rgx}|Chelsea|Clapham|Edmonton|Hampton Court|Harpenden|Harrow|Sheringham|South Kensington|South Tottenham|Welwyn Garden City|Whitechapel|New Cross|North Hackney|Regent Street|Victoria)\\\\b\"))\n\nThen get all the instance of “higher education institution”.\n\n# fetch items that are higher education institutions.\n\nhei_sparql &lt;-\n'SELECT distinct ?item ?itemLabel  \nWHERE {\n    ?item bnwdt:P12 bnwd:Q2914 .\n SERVICE wikibase:label { \n    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en,en-gb\". \n    } \n} # /where\nORDER BY ?itemLabel'\n\nhei_query &lt;-\n  bn_std_query(hei_sparql) |&gt;\n  make_bn_ids(item)\n\nUse the rules I’ve worked out to categorise the names as “the” or “zero”:\n\nhei &lt;-\n  hei_query |&gt;\n  # filter out a couple of non-specific items\n  filter(!item %in% c(\"Q2485\", \"Q2916\") ) |&gt;\n  # categorise as \"zero\" or \"the\"\n  mutate(the_label = case_when(\n    # London is a pain. \n    str_detect(itemLabel, \"^London (Society for|School of)\") ~ \"the\",\n    # otherwise, if it starts with a placename = zero\n    str_detect(itemLabel, location_rgx$rgx) ~ \"zero\",\n    # \"University etc of\" = the.\n    str_detect(itemLabel, \"(University|University College|Royal College|School|Institute) of\") ~ \"the\",\n    # anything else that's (Something) College = zero\n    str_detect(itemLabel, \"College\") ~ \"zero\",\n    # nearly all the rest = the;

This is a little bit tricky because names are not recorded in the format “surname, firstname(s)” anywhere in the wikibase. Women can have quite complex and varied names (titles, middle names, multiple surnames, etc) so that I can’t simply assume the last word in the name will serve for sorting.\nFortunately, there is information about married and birth surnames for a lot of people, which can also be used to include alternative names (“a.k.a.” or “née”) for women who changed their names.\nA note: which surname to sort by, if there’s a choice?\nThe project adopted a contextualised approach to wikibase name labels; so, for example, Jacquetta Hawkes, is not recorded as “Jacquetta Priestley” merely because that was her last husband’s surname. But for sorting purposes I do need to apply some standard rules, so I may not be able to guarantee that the ordering will always reflect the project’s preferences.

(Many Wikidata resources are equally applicable to other Wikibases; the Wikidata Query Service (WDQS) works in much the same way as the WQS.)\nKey resources I used, many of them free online:\nGeneral:\n\nLearning SPARQL book by Bob DuCharme (inexpensive)\n\nWikidata/wikibase-specific:\n\nSPARQL (Wikibooks)\nWikidata SPARQL tutorial\nWikidata Query Service tutorial\n\nHowever, I quickly discovered that I wanted to do a lot of queries that were a bit different from most of the examples in basic Wikidata/wikibase SPARQL tutorials. These tend to cover how to do quite specific things like “find items that are films (P179) in the Star Wars series (Q22092344)”\nBut I was more likely to want to ask questions that would look like “find items that are associated with the Star Wars series, but I don’t know exactly what sort of things there might be yet, oh and can I have associated dates of any type for the results as well?”.\nWriting queries to explore a wikibase where you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, or you want to get several different kinds of a thing at the same time, turned out to be quite a bit harder (and involved getting more familiar with an intimidatingly complex data model). Stack Overflow was also invaluable."

The queries page has two functions: it records the SPARQL queries for those who can read the language, but it also enables the queries to be run by those who can’t.

But it can be convenient to have functions set up for this particular purpose.\n\nglitter\n\nI played around a bit with this package which\n\naims at writing and sending SPARQL queries without advanced knowledge of the SPARQL language syntax. It makes the exploration and use of Linked Open Data (Wikidata in particular) easier for those who do not know SPARQL well.\n\nIt’s a nice package that I might well use in the future, but it wasn’t quite right for this project. I couldn’t really avoid getting to know SPARQL and I wanted to keep records of my queries in the wikibase. (My colleagues don’t know SPARQL well, it’s true… but they don’t know R either.) So it was simpler to copy and paste queries from the WQS.\n\nSPARQL\n\nThis used to be the go-to package for querying SPARQL from R. But it was removed from the official R repository a few years ago and doesn’t seem to be maintained anywhere else so I decided not to use it. (But it probably still works if you get an archived copy from CRAN.)\n\nSPARQLchunks\n\nI couldn’t quite get this package to work to do the thing it’s primarily advertised for (creating SPARQL code chunks)! But it worked perfectly for what I did want: fetching a SPARQL query and turning the results into a dataframe ready for further work.\n\n\nother Wikibase/Wikidata packages\n\nWikipediR\n\nA Wikibase is installed as part of a Mediawiki site, and can also (very usefully) contain wiki pages that aren’t part of the wikibase, and this package is useful for getting stuff out of those pages.\n\nWikidataQueryServiceR\n\nThis is a handy package to have around to query Wikidata directly. In practice I rarely used it; it’s easier to write a federated query from the WQS (though that’s likely to be slower, if speed is an issue).\n\n\nother R packages\nLarge and small packages that have been used frequently in this project:\n\ntidyverse (“an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science”; includes dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, lubridate, stringr, among others)\nhere (“uses the top-level directory of a project to easily build paths to files”)\nglue (“an implementation of interpreted string literals”, aka a smarter verson of paste/sprintf functions)\nreactable (interactive tables)\n\nggplot2 extensions for visualisations:\n\nggthemes (a bunch of extra themes and functions for ggplot2)\nggalt (more extras for ggplot2, including dumbbell charts)\nggbeeswarm (a project favourite: beeswarm plots)"

Wikibase URIs are long URL strings like https://beyond-notability.wikibase.cloud/entity/Q537.

For example, Alice Bertha Gomme was a member of (P67) the Women’s Emancipation Union (Q2711) and the Parliamentary Committee for Women’s Suffrage (Q3808); she also gave money to (P115) the Women’s Social and Political Union (Q746).\nSo this is a case where I can’t assume a fixed set of properties for a query; I need queries that will look for the P12-Q1166 combination anywhere (including a few cases where it’s not explicitly recorded on a woman’s page but an organisation she’s involved with has that instance of).

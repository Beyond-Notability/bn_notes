We’re not 100% sure what we want to do with this as yet, but as a starter to help us, do you think it might be possible, please, to do some visualisation that pulls together all flagged suffrage activity in our database across time? (We’ve also realised that some unflagged suffrage activity of event types has crept into the database so will aim to fix this, though we think all suffrage groups we know of are flagged.) Please note that we have also flagged anti-suffrage activity as suffrage activity, so preserving names of distinct suffrage orgs in whatever you come up with might be helpful.\n\nNearly all the suffrage activities in the database are dated, though charts ignore differences in kinds of date - positions are usually at year level while events are more short term. (Though they’re all point in time dates, I think, rather than start/end, so presumably none were of more than a year duration.)\nTODO\nlocations? will need more complex queries (which I’ll work out for the lecturing post first)"

Instead I’ve tried out “barcode” charts to chart timelines.\nEach vertical bar represents one date for which a suffrage activity is recorded (making no distinction between types of date). Unlike a beeswarm it won’t show every single data point if there’s more than one on the same date, but it’s possible to make more data points visible than with chunkier shapes like dots or squares, and it will indicate more intense clusters of activity (both horizontally, for individuals, and vertically, for the group as a whole).\n\norder by date of earliest activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\norder by date of birth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf only a single event needs to be plotted, a lollipop chart is also quite effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a dumbbell plot for the earliest and latest activities by each woman. There isn’t very much overlap (among women with more than 1 activity) between women who were active before 1908 and those who started 1908 or later. (But is this an absence, or just absence of data?) I’m not familiar enough with the historiography to know whether this might be expected; if not, handle with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeparating out women with at least 2 activities\n\nordered by date of earliest activity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a noticeable difference in activity types between the women with 1 activity and those with 2+. Going back to the earlier chart of PPA bucket counts, this version separates out the two groups but also shows the totals in light grey in the background - positions and societies are both quite evenly split between group 1 and group 2, but the 2+ women are much more involved in events (= mainly spoke at).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, on average members of the 2+ group were several years younger than the 1 group at the time of their first recorded suffrage activity; median age at earliest activity for 2+ is 42 and for 1 is 46.\nBut NB that this is only true of “early starters” (pre 1908) and the numbers are small (6 early starters and 5 later starters).

Recurring events are a bit more complicated to handle when counting things.\nSo, for recurring events, “event” will refer to any/all instances of (eg) “meeting of the Folklore Society” (Q31 / Q292), “Royal Archaeological Institute Meeting” (Q29), and so on.\nMeanwhile, an “event instance” refers to a single occurrence of a recurring event (eg the meeting of the Folklore Society that was held on 17 December 1903), or a one-off event. For counting one-off events “event” and “event instance” are the same thing.\nFinally, an “event attendance” refers to one woman participating in one event instance. Sometimes the same event instance appears more than once on a woman’s page under different PPAs; unless the emphasis is on the specific activity rather than the event, I’ll reduce them to one for counting purposes.\nIdentifying what is a single instance of a recurring event is not always perfectly simple, especially given the different kinds of event present in the database. At present it’s based on three elements:\n\nthe main event item, which may be generic such as “meeting” (Q31) or a named event like the “Conference on the Future of Archaeology” (Q1859)\nparticularly for generic events, the of qualifier is used for more specific info (eg the name of the event/the organisation responsible). The less frequent organised by qualifier is also used (but only where it doesn’t have instance of human).\nthe date\n\nThere are occasional variations in recording that might cause records of the same event instance to be counted separately. Eg there can be variations in date precision across different records of an event or an event might have been held over several days, so some assumptions have to be made about date grouping which could occasionally go wrong.\nConversely, in a very small number of cases, the absence of specific information might cause distinct events to be collapsed into a single instance.\nIn a few cases, there’s more than one possible way to structure a record of what could be the same event, and this will mean that they get treated as different things. Eg, there are specific items for SAL and RAI Meetings, but there are also occasional records in the form “meeting (Q31) of RAI/SAL” and it’s unclear to me whether it’s intentional (a different sort of meeting?) or just an oversight. (But I’d emphasise that this is very occasional and a minor issue.)\n\n\nupdates\n\nadded more about event activities\nadded regions heatmap; and a heatmap excluding London\nadded tables of the counts in the heatmap\n\n\n\nTODO\n\nI may be able to make a few further improvements by pulling in some infrequently used qualifiers\nSeveral events are related to suffrage activities (or other interesting subjects); nothing is being done with this kind of information at the moment. [post added on suffrage]\nLook into adding text annotations for data points of interest"

About 140 women have only a single event attendance; about 40 went to 8 or more.\nJessie MacGregor is at the top because she exhibited at the RA Summer Exhibition almost every year from 1872 to 1904 (as well as six times at the Society of Lady Artists Exhibition).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy age groups\nat least 8 attendances\n\nfewer women in the late group\nearlier women more likely to accumulate &gt;20 attendances\nbut in the 8-12 attendances range the numbers in each group are actually very similar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut overall counts can obscure interesting differences in patterns of participation. Some women, like Jessie MacGregor, might tend to attend just one or a few events; others might be spread more or less evenly across a wider range of events and/or organisations.\nThere are too many different events/organisations to show labelled breakdowns but it’s still possible to use a breakdown to get an overview of the patterns. It’s possible to see the extent to which Jessie’s participation is concentrated in just the one event, compared to, say, Margaret Murray’s profile (though Murray is also exceptional!).\nIt’s noticeable that in many cases, even women who attend several different events tend to favour one over the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis colour codes the segments by event type; it’s kinda cute but I’m not sure if it’s useful\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart can be flipped around, to look at patterns of participation by event rather than by person.\nConferences, as they’re all (or nearly all) one-off events aren’t very interesting except to show what a uniform one person per event pattern looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecurring events tend to share a similar and familiar sort of pattern (the flip side of women tending to prefer one event over others), that a relatively small number of people account for a high proportion of attendances, with a larger number of more irregular/occasional attenders. But the exact distribution varies; it may be more pronounced for smaller organisations’ events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause exhibitions are a mix of recurring and one-off events, they have a mixed pattern."

    "text": "Connections\nIn network graphs or other visualisations of connections I’m often using correlation coefficients rather than simple counts of pairs, so this is a brief explanation of what that means.\nCorrelation isn’t simply how often people are found together, which tends to give prominence to the people who appear most often in the data - Margaret Murray would turn up a lot for example, but that’s partly because she’s everywhere. Correlation coefficients are a measure of how likely pairs are to appear together relative to all the other possible pairs in the data. So they may be helpful for surfacing relationships that might not be immediately obvious simply from numbers.\nHence it’s possible to have negative as well as positive scores. Greens in the correlation plot show pairs who appear together more often than expected, purples (probably blues to James) are people who are apart more often than expected (which might sometimes be interesting too).\nCaveats\nCorrelations can be misleading in the opposite way from counts, if you have a lot of single appearances in the data (as we do). That can result in impressive looking scores of 1.0, but it just means that two women happen to be recorded just once, at the same event, which may be completely random and unrepresentative. So usually I’ll set a threshold of at least two/three appearances.\nMost of the correlations in this kind of data aren’t very strong by statisticians’ standards: +/- 0.4 is usually the threshold for “moderate” strength, although I think for exploratory purposes anything from 0.25 upwards can be of interest. (For reference, the Jessie MacGregor-Rosa Wallis link scores only 0.21.)\nA correlation plot of women with at least 9 attendances (it’s not really possible to squeeze more names in).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork graphs\n(darker lines represent stronger correlations)"

Very very broadly speaking it’s somewhere in the same zone (a few nodes with high degree, a lot of nodes with low degree). But it has bulges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy period (excluding the handful of 1940s excavations).\nThe 1900s set is too small for any statistical analysis to be meaningful. The 1920s are a bit weird. The 1930s look much the same as the overall picture (considering they form the bulk of it, not surprising).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA different kind of split, by number of participants per excavation. Interestingly, the distribution of excavations with up to 5 people looks much more like the “expected” pattern. The bulginess is in the larger excavations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is happening because the large excavations have quite a lot of people who only appear in those large excavations, often in just one. If there are (for example) 20 people on an excavation and 18 of them are only recorded on that excavation, the 18 will all have degree of 18. Notably, the single larger 1920s excavation, Richborough (Q3380), has 17 participants and only three of them appear on any other excavation. (The decade as a whole has only 79 named participants in 43 excavations.)\nThis is one of the reasons why simply counting links between nodes in a network is a limited measure; it can be useful, like this, to get a picture of the network as a whole but misleading for understanding individuals within the network."

    "text": "Highly connected individuals\nThe limitations of counting links is why a number of different “centrality” measures have been developed in network analysis. These heatmaps compare rankings for four of the most commonly used:\n\ndegree (how many connections a node has)\nbetweenness (how well a node connects other nodes)\neigenvector (how close a node is to well-connected nodes)\nharmonic closeness (on average, how close a node is to every other node in the network)\n\n(I’m using rankings because the measures produce very different sorts of scores which are not directly comparable.)\nTop ten rankings are coloured and other rankings are in grey. The most striking thing here is just how much they can vary. Only one person (Tessa Verney Wheeler) is in the top ten on every measure.\nAn interesting absence is Margaret Murray who is recorded in 7 excavations (the same number as Mortimer Wheeler) but she has only 18 connections and her highest ranking is at 22 [betweenness].\nAlso perhaps worth noting that Maud and B.H. Cunnington are absolutely nowhere in any rankings in spite of being recorded on more excavations than anyone else (9), because they only connect to each other. That may reflect the sources too, given that most of their excavations were pre-WW1, though I see that Maud had a reputation for being “difficult”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there’s so much variation I hesitated over doing averages of the rankings; I’ve tried out a boxplot combined with beeswarm. It’s possibly a bit odd looking (lol) but I quite like it.\nIt turns out that at the top end of the chart (it’s been sorted by median average) there’s quite a bit of consistency; for 2 to 10 the lowest rankings are in the 20s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrying the beeswarm/boxplots for sub-networks\n1930s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1920s\nThis decade looks really weird. (Miss Hobling, Aileen Fox and Joscelyn Plunket Bushe-Fox are the three Richborough people who are on at least one other excavation.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-WW1\nAgain, a bit doubtful but does at least put some individuals you’d expect at the top. Margaret Murray’s back! I expanded it to the top 12 just to see where Petrie had got to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe big four problem\nSo far, so weird. The “big four” excavations (Maiden Castle, Colchester, Verulamium and Richborough) are really causing all sorts of problems here. While I would assume that they really were important and big excavations - hence the existence of detailed records compared to many others - they’re having some very disproportionate effects. This is most obvious for Richborough in the 1920s, given that there’s more data generally for the 1930s. But not confined to it.\nTo go back to the top 10s, several of these apparently high ranked individuals only appear in one or more of the big excavations. This may not necessarily be “wrong”; Wikipedia tells me that Hugh O’Neil really was an important figure in British archaeology. Huntley S Gordon, on the other hand, doesn’t even seem to be listed in the ADS library.\nI don’t want to drop the big excavations entirely. But could I remove some of their data to make them more consistent with the level of recording we have for other excavations?\nOne thing it’s easy to do is simply take out those people who do not appear in any other excavations and see what happens. (Yes, this is probably a really monstrous idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(In this version Tessa and Mortimer have identical median average, though Tessa still comes out top by mean.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a more accurate picture of the most connected people in the network, but it is arguably a more useful one.\n\n\ncircles\nSome very simple graphs of the links for the top ranked. These are just their immediate connections (I can’t at the moment quite get a cleverer neighbourhood graph to work properly; will update if I can work out the problem).\nThe focus person is the centre node; the length and weight of edges represent the number of connections (shorter and darker = more connections). Colour is used for gender.\nHere’s Tessa Verney Wheeler’s “circle” including everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after removing the big-four-only individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame for Mortimer Wheeler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, this is the circle for Hugh O’Neil. (I’m not going to do any other ‘removed’ individuals because (guess what!) they’re virtually the same.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rest are the “removed” versions only, but I can do the full ones if wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther circles of possible interest…\n(I can do others on request)"

The algorithm successively removes edges with the highest betweenness, recalculating betweenness values after each removal. This way eventually the network splits into two components, then one of these components splits again, and so on, until all edges are removed. network graph highlighting the 8 largest community clusters.

Project data on PPAs still very incomplete for post-1920s period, at least until CAS Earthworks and Blue Paper data is fully added, but even if we could begin to get a sense for the 1870 - 1920 period this would be very helpful to us.\n\n\nUpdated to use the PPA buckets\nI’ve moved the Big Blob versions to the bottom of the page since there was a clear preference for the separated approach!"

    "text": "Notes on some of the complexities\n\ngeneral concepts\nBroadly the main issues are variability in a. precision, b. certainty, c. formatting and d. omission rates.\nDates are a problem for just about everyone who has to work with them, whether historians or data people. (Sometimes the way that software attempts to deal with the problem makes them a problem for everyone else as well, such as the notorious eagerness of spreadsheet software to convert into date format anything that even remotely resembles a date.)\n\n\nwikibase structure and variety\nDates may be recorded as “main” (or top level) values or qualifiers, which need to be queried separately.\nThe majority of dates are qualifiers, and there are around 50 different properties for events or activities that might have qualifier dates. That is a lot of categories to try to analyse or visualise together.\nThen there are several different possible date properties\n\n\ndatatypes and technical constraints\nMain level dates may have one of two different datatypes: Time (ymdHMS format), which is the built-in Wikibase datatype, or EDTF (Extended Date/Time Format) for “fuzzier” dates. Qualifier dates (so far…) only have the Time datatype.\n\nTime dates are always stored and exported by the wikibase (and handled by R) in a year-month-day format, even if they’ve been recorded at a lower level of precision (eg year only); the precision level is stored separately and has to be specifically queried. (A year-only date, for example, is stored as YYYY-01-01, so without the precision level it’s impossible to differentiate it from an actual 1 January date.)\nEDTF dates are exported as text strings which need to be converted to dates separately. So far they’ve been used in a fairly straightforward way, mirroring the precision levels for Time dates, but they could be much more complex including uncertainty, approximation, date ranges, etc. [This comment is not intended as encouragement.]\n\nIf I run a basic union query in the WQS combining Time/EDTF dates in one column, the EDTF dates will be automatically simplified and converted to the same format as Time dates. So if I want to retain the extra information I have to separate out those variables and then re-combine them after processing.\n\n\nvarying precision/certainty in sources and recording them\nFor qualifier dates there are five different properties which reflect different ways that dates might have been recorded, or degrees of certainty in interpreting them: point in time; start time; end time; earliest date; latest date.\n\na pair of start time and end time represents a period of time\nbut often only one of start/end is recorded\npoint in time may represent either a discrete short term event or simply a known recorded moment in a longer duration\nit looks as though latest date can be very imprecise\n(and presumably earliest can be too, though I think there aren’t many of them)\n\n\nDates may not be recorded at all, and some dates are more likely to be recorded than others.\nA date might be missing because it really is completely unknown, or because the project doesn’t have time and resources to track down everything (!), or because some sources are work in progress, or simply because of technical issues fetching the data (eg The Bug).\n\n\ndata issues\nThere are occasional apparent inconsistencies in usage on the wikibase which can be difficult to interpret (ie, they could be errors but equally they could be deliberate choices to handle unusual cases): eg at time of writing there is one date for the property married name (for Olwen Brogan) and it’s not clear why this isn’t recorded as married in. [Update: this particular example has now been fixed.] I’d emphasise that such inconsistencies seem rare and minor problems.\nOccasionally there may be more than one recorded date to choose from (apart from start/end pairs), though I think there are fewer of these now than there were a few months ago. I think this might tend to occur because an event was recorded with different precision/certainty in different sources, so deciding which of the two dates to use (whether by editing the wikibase or filtering one out at the analysis stage) can be a choice between precision and certainty. Most I’ve seen are in the same year, in which case it’s a minor issue.\n(Annoyingly, some sparql queries return duplicates, which is a very different data problem from having multiple dates in a statement… but not necessarily immediately obvious to tell apart.)"

More generally, it can be difficult to ensure that dates in the same year but with low or different precision levels come out in the desired order (or even to decide what the desired order in those cases should be).\nA year-only date should display as 01/01/year but in some cases below the software package used to render the table is displaying them as 31/12 of the previous year, and I have no idea why: the underlying data is fine. (It may only affect certain dates.) I’ll work out how to fix it."

<p>Can you make a bee swarm-type diagram that plots the frequency of PPAs across all the women in the dataset, across the entire project period? So with years ascending up the y axis, and all the women considered one big blotchy group (am sure that’s the technical term). What we want to get is an overview of whether certain kinds of PPA were more dominant at various periods of the overall period covered by the project, e.g.&nbsp;women suddenly started doing more excavation or whatnot in the 1910s, whereas before that there was almost no excavation activity associated with women. Project data on PPAs still very incomplete for post-1920s period, at least until CAS Earthworks and Blue Paper data is fully added, but even if we could begin to get a sense for the 1870 - 1920 period this would be very helpful to us.</p>

<p>These are another option for this kind of comparison of trends. They’re also not dependent on colour, so it’s not necessary to reduce categories quite so brutally. I’ve included education this time.</p>
<p>They show the <em>proportion</em> of dates (rather than counts) in each “bin” (5?-year-period) for each category. So categories are directly comparable regardless of size (though very small ones can be a bit misleading).</p>
<p>I’ve experimented with using colour as an indication of the size of the category - the lighter the shade of blue the larger the category (but I’ve done it in a really hacky sort of way and would need to fix it properly).</p>

<p>This is a variation on the same theme. The ridgeline shows a smoothed trend line, but this adds the actual distribution of dates as points, so it’s a bit more like the beeswarm. Colours are just for fun this time around.</p>

<p>This is adapted from the maps for lecturers.</p>
<p>filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>years (again, sorry about the number formatting)
<ul>
<li>you can filter start/end years independently or as a fixed date range (narrow down to a range, eg five years apart, and then drag the horizontal blue bar)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>people</li>
<li>organisations</li>
<li>localities</li>
<li>event types (meeting, conference, “other”)
<ul>
<li>most “other” are probably also meetings but I don’t have quite enough data to identify them with certainty</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also make a selection in the map itself; click on the button just beneath the + and - buttons.</p>
<p>Bear in mind (as with the lecturers map) that when there is more than one data point at the same location, you can only see one label; the others are hidden behind it.</p>
<p>In particular, many conferences (dark blue) are hidden behind meetings which may give a misleading impression.</p>
<p>Circles hiding multiple data points are likely to be darker than singles and a slightly different colour if there are mixed event types. Sometimes filters will help. The table also reacts automatically to the filters so you can see the full data for any filtered selection.</p>
